    "\n",
    "> 1. Implementing and evaluating a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and convolutional neural network (CNN) in solving a classification problem\n",
    "> 2. Building, evaluating, and finetuning a CNN on an image dataset from development to testing \n",
    "> 3. Tackling overfitting using strategies such as data augmentation and drop out\n",

    "> 2. Set your **Kaggle account NAME** to your university username, for example, ``sc15jb``.\n",
    "\n",
    "The class Kaggle competition also includes a blind test set, which will be used in Question 1 for evaluating your custom model's performance on a test set. The competition website will compute the test set accuracy, as well as position your model on the class leaderboard. [Link to submit your results on Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/comp5623m-artificial-intelligence/submissions). \n",
    "\n",
    "Please submit only your predictions from test set - detailed instructions are provided in (3)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. Submission of your work\n",
    "\n",
