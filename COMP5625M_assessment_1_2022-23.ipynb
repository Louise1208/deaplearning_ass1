    "\n",
    "The class Kaggle competition also includes a blind test set, which will be used in Question 1 for evaluating your custom model's performance on a test set. The competition website will compute the test set accuracy, as well as position your model on the class leaderboard. [Link to submit your results on Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/comp5623m-artificial-intelligence/submissions).\n",
    "\n",
    "Please submit only your predictions from test set - detailed instructions are provided in (3)\n",

Therefore, we found that although the general features were captured, it was not very effective in helping the model make correct predictions. This may be the reason why the CNN model can accurately classify these images but the accuracy rate is still relatively low.\n",

For example, for the CNN model, it is necessary to strengthen the identification of some key features. And it is same for the ALexnet model. Increasing the amount of data can help it distinguish key features to improve training accuracy."
